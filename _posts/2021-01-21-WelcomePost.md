# Welcome! An Introduction

Thanks for checking out my blog. My career in finance and architecture led me to discover my interest in design research and innovation. I'm starting to explore the world of No Code as well.

I am the Secretary and a Board Member of the [American Restroom Association](https://americanrestroom.org/), America's advocate for the availability of clean, safe, well designed public restrooms.

In my spare time I enjoy origami, D&D, bad New York sports teams, and spending time with my partner and cat.

Please feel free to reach out to me for any collaborations or questions!
